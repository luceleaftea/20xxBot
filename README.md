# 20xxBot
A Reddit bot for r/smashbros

A python bot written by luceleaftea during his Sophomore year of college.  Originally hosted
on a Raspberry Pi in his basement, he took it down in the process of moving during his Senior year and put it up
on Heroku and open-sourced the code on GitHub during the winter of 2017, after graduating from college.

If you're interesting in helping out, feel free to fork the project and make a pull request to me! I'll try to keep
issues open of bugs/features that need working on, but if there aren't any issues feel free to message me.


TO-DO: Instructions on setting up the bot "locally" (ish) for testing
